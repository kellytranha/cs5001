Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
No I did not
If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
My computer player is as smart as I could do
How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
I find all available moves then pick one of them for the computer
How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
Sometimes
How would you improve it in the future?
I would like it to be a little bit smarter than just being random.
